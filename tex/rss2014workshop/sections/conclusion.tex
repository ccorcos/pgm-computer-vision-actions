We have presented a probabilistic interactive object recognition model that incorporates actions over time.  A solution was derived for determining the optimal action for improving object recognition, and an experiment on the ambiguous book problem shows promising results.

    %There are several areas for future work in this domain. We believe that incorporating other features into this model such as 3D point cloud or color histogram features will increase the accuracy of the object-pose prediction.
    %Other future work lies in loosening our constraints on discrete poses with perfect actions into continuous poses and continuous actions.
