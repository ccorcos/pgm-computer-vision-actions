We have presented a probabilistic interactive object recognition model that incorporates actions over time.  A solution was derived for determining the optimal action for improving object recognition, and an experiment on the ambiguous book problem shows promising results.

    There are several areas for future work in this domain. First is with the measurement model subgraph. Currently, we are facing an issue with overfitting when we train the ambiguous poses with different sets of data. We believe that incorporating other features into this model such as 3D point cloud or color histogram features may help with this problem.
    Other future work lies in loosing our constraints on discrete poses with perfect actions into continuous poses and continuous actions.
