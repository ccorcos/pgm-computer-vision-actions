We have presented a probabilistic framework for interactive object recognition. We formulated a minimum expected entropy principle for determining the optimal action to reduce uncertainty in object recognition. A preliminary experiment on the ambiguous book problem shows encouraging results.

    %There are several areas for future work in this domain. We believe that incorporating other features into this model such as 3D point cloud or color histogram features will increase the accuracy of the object-pose prediction.
    There are several areas for future work in this domain. We believe that loosening our constraints on discrete poses with perfect actions into continuous poses and noisy actions will enable this work to be very useful in cluttered environments.
