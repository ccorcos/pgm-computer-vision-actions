\section{Introduction}

    %* show the problem
    %* introduce the idea
    %* contributions?

    % I would try something more like this. let me know what you think... 
    Many state-of-the-art object recognition systems have been developed using a variety of feature extraction techniques. As computer vision matures, it is important to leverage all useful feature extraction techniques together in a single for the best object recognition results. However, static object recognition will always have its limits. Sometimes an object may appear ambiguous with respect to another object, and sometimes distinctive features may hidden due to its pose.  In this paper we present an approach to help tackle both of these problems.

    % the BN
    We introduce a probabilistic graphical model for combining arbitrary feature extraction techniques into a single object recognition system with the requirement that for any feature type there must be a function given for computing the matching error between two features of the same type. 

    % Action prediction
    This model also learns to recognize object in various poses. With this information, we formulate an approach leveraging robotic manipulation to determine the optimal action for future expected object recognition.  
% I like the beginning. However after that I think you get too much into the details of how exactly it works. Introduction is supposed to be very broad. I wouldn't mention multiple feature types here.    
    

    % OLD INTRO
        % % problem of static object recognition
        % Although multiple successful state-of-the-art object recognition systems have been developed, we still cannot say that the problem of object recognition has been solved.
        % We claim that the reason for that is already included in the problem formulation. Given static images there are cases where it is impossible to recognize the object simply because of lack of distinctive features (see~\figref{fig:pr2}). One way to overcome this problem has been presented in the area of object segmentation where robot-objects interaction was introduced. 

        % % introduce the idea
        % In this work we take advantage of robot's manipulation capabilities and apply them in the domain of object recognition. In our approach we tackle interactive object recognition problem where we look for the action that will minimize the expected entropy over objects distribution. Therefore we want to be optimal in the number of actions that will lead us to successful object recognition.

    % static object recognition intro
	Research in perception has traditionally focused on  static images and recognized objects based on a set of visual features such as SIFT~\cite{lowe2004distinctive}, SURF~\cite{bay2006surf} or ORB~\cite{rublee2011orb}.
    There has also been plethora of work on static object recognition that resulted in various systems.
	
    % examples of static object recognition systems	
	One of the most efficient and robust object recognition systems was developed by Tang et al.~\cite{tang2012textured}. The authors use color model matching and SIFT feature matching to recognize the object. The algorithm also performs geometric pose estimation as well as final scene verification and refinement using global scene consistency checks. 

    A different approach was discussed by Weijer and Khan~\cite{van2013fusing} where the authors compare various bag-of-words based recognition algorithms. The algorithm represents an image as a set of local regions where each of them is represented as a visual vocabulary. Different objects correspond to different histograms (called bags-of-words) over the created vocabulary. An extracted bag-of-words histogram can be compared to all the histograms stored in the memory and thus, an object can be labelled as one of the previously seen objects.

    Although very successful both of these approaches would not be able to correctly recognize the ambiguous object presented in~\figref{fig:pr2}. That is why we employ robot manipulation to solve that problem.

    %intro to interactive segmentation
    The idea of a robot interacting with the scene to improve its perceptual skills has been particularly explored in the area of interactive segmentation.

    %interactive segmentation
    Segmentation of rigid objects from a video stream of objects being moved by a robot was first addressed by Fitzpatrick et. al.~\cite{fitzpatrick_active_vision} and Kenney et. al.~\cite{KenneyInteractive}. Katz and Brock~\cite{Katz-WS-MM-ICRA2011} address the problem of segmenting the articulated objects. Another technique was presented by \cite{bergstrom11icvs}, where the authors propose an approach to interactive segmentation that requires initial labeling using  a 3D segmentation through fixation which results in a rough initial segmentation. The robot interacts with the scene to disambiguate the hypotheses.

    %something about methods using expected entropy?

    %our work intro interactive object recognition
    All these approaches do not take into consideration action choices. Actions are assumed to be known and performed either by a human or a robot. In this work we introduce a probabilistic method to choose the best action based on robot's observations. To the best of our knowledge, the problem of interactive object recognition has not been addressed before. 

\section{Approach}
    This model has two parts. The first part deals only with object recognition and the second part extends this model for determining optimal actions. The object recognition model is a simple discriminative model for predicting object and pose. This model is agnostic of the type of features used so long as there exists some matching function for comparing features of the same type. The action selection part of this model extends the object recognition model in time and determines the optimal actions by the minimum expected entropy of the object predictions across all potential actions. 
    % it's ok, but I wouldn't emphasize different types of features so much. we mentioned it once already, it's fine. Apart from that, we definitely need to work on language, it has to be much more scientific.

    \subsection{Object Recognition Model}
        The object recognition model predicts an object and a pose based on observed features. Objects and poses are treated discriminatively. This model consists of $N$ objects, $O \in \{o_1,o_2, ..., o_N\}$ in $I$ poses $P \in \{p_1,p_2, ..., p_I\}$ resulting in $K = N \cdot I$ object-pose pairs. There are $M$ features of $J$ types $\set{F} = \{\set{F}^1,\set{F}^2, ..., \set{F}^J\} = \left\{ f_1, ...,  f_M\right\}$. This model assumes features are conditionally independent given object and pose. This model also assumes a uniform prior on the object and pose. Thus, the joint distribution is factorized as in equation \ref{eq:fac} resulting a graph showing in figure \ref{fig:simpleGraph}.
        %I think there's something wrong with equation on the feature types. I dont get this part: = \left\{ f_1, ...,  f_M\right\  
        %Also, I wouldn't put the factorization equation here. It's too obvious.

        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:fac}
            \prob{O,P,\set{F}} = \prob{O}\prob{P}\prob{\set{F}|O,P}
        \end{equation}

        \begin{figure}[h]

            % Define nodes
            \node[obs]                            (F) {$\set{F}$};
            \node[latent, above=of F, xshift=-1.5cm] (O) {$O$};
            \node[latent, above=of F, xshift=1.5cm]  (P) {$P$};

            % Connect the nodes
            \edge {P,O} {F};

            % Plates
            \plate {} {(F)} {$M$}
          \end{tikzpicture}
          \caption{Simple object recognition graph.}
          \label{fig:simpleGraph}
        \end{figure}

    \subsubsection{Model Construction}
        Before training this model, we first must construct the structure of this model. We selected a set of objects and chose a number of poses we wanted the model to learn. We gathered a set of features for each object-pose pair in an ideal setting to create an initial dataset.
        % I would introduce a term here. Like a database for example. So that we can refer to it later.

        \begin{equation}
            \cursive{D} = \left\{ \left(o_k,p_k,\set{F}_k\right)^{k=K}_{k=1} \right\}
        \end{equation}
% I think that this indexing with k is confusing. because now it seems that there is k objects.. I know what you want to say. But I think I would even remove this. Also, structure of a model sounds like we want to infer the structure of the graph...

        The model was constructed as set of all unique objects, poses, and features observed in $\cursive{D}$. % I dont really understand this sentence. What is the model exactly?

    \subsubsection{Feature Likelihood + Training}
        The likelihood of a feature, $\prob{f|o,p}$ is a distribution derived from feature matching errors. Each feature in the model has an associated type $j$ and a value or descriptor with which to compute a matching error $\cursive{E}^j(\cdot,\cdot)$ with respect to another feature of the same type. 

        Given an observed set of features, $\set{F}_{\text{obs}}$, the best matching error with respect to a feature in the model $f^j \in \set{F}$ is given by equation
         \ref{eq:bestMatch}.
     	% I put new commands in for referencing equations, figures and so on. Please use those.    
         %matching, descriptors - these are very SIFT-like terms. I don't think one can understand what we mean by matching now. That's why I would also move away from being so generic and just concentrate on our features. At the end we can mention that it is also extendable to other feature types.

        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:bestMatch}
            \cursive{E}(f^j) = \min_{f^j_{\text{obs}} \in \set{F}_{\text{obs}}}\cursive{E}^j(f^j,f^j_{\text{obs}})
        \end{equation}

        We record a set of training data consisting of $R$ sets of data for each object-pose pair, $k$. We compute a set of best matching errors for each feature in the model across all training samples and learn the distribution of these errors.

        \begin{equation}
            \prob{f|o,p} \sim \{\cursive{E}_1(f), ...,  \cursive{E}_R(f)\}
        \end{equation}

        Note that this procedure is agnostic of the type of feature used. In our case, we used SIFT features and fit the errors with a normal distribution. 

        \begin{equation}
            \prob{f_m|o_n,p_i} \sim \cursive{N}(\mu_{m}^{n,i},\sigma_{m}^{n,i})
        \end{equation}
% I would remove the m index here. It doesnt help much and it's not easily readable

    \subsubsection{Object-Pose Inference}

        The posterior is given by equation \ref{eq:objPosePosterior}.

        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:objPosePosterior}
            \prob{o,p|\set{F}} = \frac{\prob{o,p} \cdot \prob{\set{F}|o,p}}{\prob{\set{F}}}
        \end{equation}

        % We first assume a uniform prior.

        % \begin{equation}
        %   \prob{o} = \frac{1}{N}
        % \end{equation}
        % \begin{equation}
        %   \prob{p} = \frac{1}{I}
        % \end{equation}
        % \begin{equation}
        %   \prob{o,p} = \frac{1}{K}
        % \end{equation}

        Assuming a uniform prior on objects and poses, the posterior can then be computed as shown in eqution \ref{eq:objPosePosteriorComp}.

        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:objPosePosteriorComp}
            \prob{o,p|\set{F}} = \frac{\prob{\set{F}|o,p}}{\sum_{n,i} \prob{\set{F}|o_n,p_i}}
        \end{equation}
        
        %I would definitely remove the last equation. We need to write that features are independent given object and a pose and thats why we multiply them.


    \subsection{Action Selection Model}
        The action selection model extends the object-recognition model into a time-series model. Actions are modeled as $I$ pairwise relative pose transformations including the \italic{stay} action to determine when the algorithm has converged. The next pose, $P_{t+1}$ is dependent only on the previous pose, $P_t$ and the previous action $A_t$. For our experiment, we consider actions to be deterministic, i.e. $\prob{P_{t+1}|P_t,A_t} \in \{ 0 , 1 \}$.

    \subsubsection{First Action}
        After initially observing data $\set{F}_1$, we compute the posterior for all object-poses. We consider what is the optimal action $a \in A_1$ which would lead to a new pose $P_2$ and reveal new features $\set{F}_2$. This joint distribution is factorized by equation \ref{eq:firstActionFactorized}, depicted in figure \ref{fig:firstActionGraph}.

        \begin{multline}
            \label{eq:firstActionFactorized}
            \prob{O,P_1,P_2,\set{F}_1, \set{F}_2, A_1} = \\ \prob{O}\prob{P_1}\prob{\set{F}_1|O,P}\prob{P_2|P_1|A_1}\prob{\set{F}_2|O,P_2}
        \end{multline}

        \begin{figure}[h]
          \centering
          \begin{tikzpicture}
            % Define nodes
            \node[obs] (F) {$\set{F}_1$};
            \node[latent, above=of F]  (P) {$P_1$};

            \node[obs, above=of P]  (A) {$A_1$};

            \node[latent, right=of F, xshift=1.5cm] (F2) {$\set{F}_2$};

            % Connect the nodes
            \edge {P,O} {F};

          \end{tikzpicture}
          \label{fig:firstActionGraph}
          \caption{First action model}
        \end{figure}
        %we can show how posterior looks for one action but after that let's stay with the generic formulation. Also with the graph - it should definitely be for n. That way it is more professional

        The posterior for the after the first action is computed as a simple update of the first posterior shown in equation \ref{eq:firstActionPosterior}.

        \begin{multline}
          \label{eq:firstActionPosterior}
          \prob{o|\set{F}_1,\set{F}_2,a} = \\ \frac{\sum_{P_1,P_2} \prob{o,P_1|\set{F}_1} \; \prob{\set{F}_2|P_2,o} \; \prob{P_2|P_1,a}}{\sum_{P_1,P_2,O} \prob{O,P_1|\set{F}_1} \; \prob{\set{F}_2|P_2,O} \; \prob{P_2|P_1,a}}
        \end{multline}

        To determine the optimal action we compute the minimum expected entropy of object prediction for the distribution in equation \ref{eq:firstActionPosterior} given by equation \ref{eq:firstActionOptimal}.
        %TODO: we need more explanation on this. Why expected entropy? why does it work?

        \begin{equation}
          \label{eq:firstActionOptimal}
          a^* = \argmin_{A_1} \expectedValue{\entropy{O|\set{F}_1,\set{F}_2,A_1}}{\set{F}_2 \sim \prob{\set{F_2}|\set{F}_1,A_1}}
        \end{equation}

    \subsubsection{Generalized Optimal Action}
        Determining the optimal action at time $t$ is easily generalized from equation \ref{eq:firstActionPosterior}.

        % \begin{figure}[h]
        %   \centering

        Our implementation uses a particle filter for computing the optimal action.
        % this is not a particle filter stricte but we use MCMC method to approximate distributions. Also, we shouldn't put implementation in.

\section{Experimental Results}

    We evaluated the proposed approach on a dataset consisting of 4 books, two of which looking the same from the back. Each book was trained in 4 discrete poses being: cover up with visible spine, cover up with no visible spine, cover down with visible spine and cover down with no visible spine. For each object-pose pair we extracted approximately 50 SIFT features which are later used for feature matching. We took 100 training images of each object-pose pair to learn the distribution ADD EQ REF. For the ambiguous case (the book looks the same from the cover down pose) we use the same training images as the books look the same from that side.

    Our experimental setup consists of a Microsoft Kinect sensor which we use as a RGB camera and one of the objects from the database. All the actions are executed by a human and we assume that there is no noise in the action execution. 

    \subsection{Object Recognition}
        %*cross validation error,

    \subsection{Action Selection}
        The experiment is constructed as follows. We expose an object to the Kinect sensor and obtain the recognition result. In the next step we employ the action selection algorithm to choose the best action and we execute it. In order to measure if the action improved the previous recognition we compute the posterior probability of the object. We execute actions until the algorithm converges which means that the action selection algorithm returns action called 'stay'.

        We ran the above described experiment in various conditions, i.e. different books and different starting poses(ambiguous and non-ambiguous). The results are described in TABLE REF


        %*explain our setup
        % we have a kinect, 4 object, 4 poses each, 50 sift features per object-pose pair
        % 100 training images per object-pose pair
        % we move the object with our hands for now
        %  

        %*assumptions
        % perfect actions (no noise)
        % discrete poses 
        % we see one object at a time
        % we see a known object

        %*explain experiment
        % we show the object to the kinect and recognize it based on our recognition module
        % results for all objects and poses are in the table
        % we figure out the best action (in the table)
        % we check recognition after the action has been taken (in the table)


        \begin{itemize}
        \item explain our dataset
        \item show pictures of objects
        \item show cross validation results for our training
        \item explain the setup
        \item show real data results for object recognition (table)
        \item discuss the results, emphasize that the action selection works
        \end{itemize}

        \section{Conclusions}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item discuss the results
        \item what failed what succeeded
        \item talk about possible extensions: continuous pose, more feature types, on the robot
        \end{itemize}
