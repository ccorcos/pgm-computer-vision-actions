    Objects are rarely observed in ideal conditions. This could be due to an orientation that is featureless or ambiguous with other objects. To resolve this issue, a robot ought to perform some action to improve its recognition. This paper introduces probabilitic graphical model that infers object and pose based on a history of actions and observations. An optimal action is computed by the minimum expected entropy of object predictions. This result could be directly applied to a variety of tasks involving a robot searching or retreiving an item when object recognition is uncertain.
